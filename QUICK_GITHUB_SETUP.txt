# Quick GitHub Setup (2 minutes)

Your code is already committed locally. Now push it to GitHub:

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `gold-price-tracker`
3. Description: `Real-time gold price tracker with rates from multiple Indian jewellers`
4. Choose **PUBLIC** (important for free Vercel hosting)
5. Click **Create repository**

## Step 2: Push Code

Copy-paste this command after creating the repo (replace YOUR_USERNAME):

```bash
cd /Users/abhishek/dev/gold
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gold-price-tracker.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**That's it!** Your code will be on GitHub in 30 seconds.

## Next: Deployment Setup

After GitHub push is complete, I can:
1. ✅ Deploy backend to **Render** (Express API)
2. ✅ Deploy frontend to **Vercel** (Next.js Web)
3. ✅ Get you custom URLs for both

Expected final URLs:
- Website: `https://gold-tracker-web.vercel.app` (or custom domain)
- API: `https://gold-tracker-api.onrender.com`

**IMPORTANT**: Don't deploy yet - wait until your code is on GitHub first.
Once pushed, I'll automatically set everything up for you.
